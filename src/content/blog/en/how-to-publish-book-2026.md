I don’t want to waste your time, so I’m going to be blunt. The best way to publish a book in 2026 is not through Amazon, it's not through IngramSpark, and it's definitely not through traditional book publishing companies.

Just like music record labels, these companies are designed to take as much money from you as possible for the rest of your life.

## The Gold Standard (If You Can Afford It)
It doesn't benefit my company at all to tell you this, but the absolute best way to publish a book in 2026 is to buy your own ISBN directly from the official U.S. source, **Bowker**. Once you own your own identifier, you are a published writer. That's it.

* **Official Website:** [www.myidentifiers.com](https://www.myidentifiers.com)
* **The Cost:** At this time, 1 ISBN is **$125 USD**.

Yeah, that’s pretty steep if you’re balling on a budget like most first-time authors. So, if you can’t justify that price right now, what is the best alternative for publishing without letting the sharks of the industry take huge chunks of your profits for years to come?

## The Reality of "Free" Publishing and Industry Sharks
Most authors start their journey dreaming of a traditional publishing deal. This is basically the book version of a major record deal. You picture a big, respected publisher taking you under their wing.

In reality, it usually comes with one-sided contracts where you give up a massive percentage of your royalties and sometimes even your copyright. You end up doing most of the promotion yourself, but they still take their cut. Even big players like Amazon offer a "free ISBN," but it locks you into their ecosystem. They own the metadata and you’re just a guest in their house.

If your book goes viral, these publishing sharks are the ones benefiting the most, even though all the hard work came from you.

## Why Clarinbridge Publishing is Different
My name is Zack. I’m a published author who has sold books around the world, and I’ve been exactly where you are. I saw the publishing world was more like a house of thieves than a supportive community, and my team and I wanted to change that.

That’s why the safest option for publishing in 2026, besides the $125 Bowker route, is through **Clarinbridge Publishing**.

We offer simple and affordable publishing services to help you obtain your ISBNs without taking any royalties or commissions. You keep your work, you keep your profits, and you keep your soul.
